== Description ==
In just few clicks, you can start offering Apple Pay on your Woocommerce Store.

**What is Buyte Mobile Payments?**
Buyte provides a widget that allows you to implement Apple Pay with a simple snippet and have it exposed across all browsers and devices. No longer are your customers force to use Safari to pay with Apple Pay.
